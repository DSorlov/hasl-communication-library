Home Assistant SL Sensor (HASL) Communication Library
===============================

This module provides the low level communications functionality used by the [Home Assistant SL Sensor](https://github.com/DSorlov/hasl-platform).

>__NOTE__: This code is really not supported for use outside of Home Assistant, even if that should be possible in it self.

If you're reading this on the project's github page, the package is available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hasl/).
